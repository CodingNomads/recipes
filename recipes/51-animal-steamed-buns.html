<p>Recipe:<br/>
<strong>Plain Buns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All Purpose Flour (800 grams)</li>
<li>Yeast (8 grams)</li>
<li>Sugar (40 grams)</li>
<li>Water (400 grams)</li>
<li>Canola Oil (as needed)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alternative Buns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pumpkin, Sweet Potato, etc (250 grams)</li>
<li>All Purpose Flour (300 grams)</li>
<li>Sugar (40 grams)</li>
<li>Yeast (3-4 grams)</li>
<li>Water (as needed)</li>
<li>Canola Oil (as needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other ingredients for decoration: Food coloring, Dried Dates, Beans, etc</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare your choice of starch (potato or pumpkin etc) and peel, cut into small pieces. Steam until it is extremely soft. This can take from 20-40 minutes depending on what you use. Potato takes much longer than Pumpkin.</li>
<li>Mush and mix into a paste, then add the sugar and yeast, give it a mix. Start adding flour in increments and begin to knead the dough together. Dough should feel very flexible, but not sticky. Knead for about 5 minutes then let the dough rise for 30 minutes. Knead for another 3 minutes and let rest for 1.5-3 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>At this point if the dough still feels kinda sticky you can knead in some more flour. Knead into a ball and cover with saran wrap. Take small pieces of dough out and mold the dough into whatever shape you need. Watch video for some technique and examples.</li>
<li>Once finished, let each bun rise for another 20 minutes and then steam for 15 minutes. Be sure you have some parchment paper under each buns. Done!</li>
</ol>

<p>To prepare plain white dough:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mix a cup with water, yeast and sugar. Then add in increments into a bowl with flour and begin kneading. Same exact steps as above. Knead, rest, knead and rest. Then shape as needed.</li>
