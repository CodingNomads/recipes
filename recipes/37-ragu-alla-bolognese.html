            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by danos95</p>
            <div class="md"><p>I thought it would be cool to make a very traditional Ragu alla Bolognese; i.e. the sauce that was the catalyst for the famed &#39;Spaghetti Bolognese&#39; dish a lot of us know and love. This dish is said to have originated in Italy&#39;s Bologna region hence the name. For anyone interested it was Pelligrino Artusi who first published ragu as a recipe back in 1891.   </p>

<p>The below recipe is just for the ragu sauce - it will make enough to top 6 servings of pasta. Best pasta to serve this with is tagliatelle, fettucine, or pappardelle. </p>

<p>Prep Time: 30 minutes</p>

<p>Cook Time: 3+ hours</p>

<p>Total Time: Approx 6 hours</p>

<p>Servings: 6</p>

<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>

<ul>
<li>Saucepan</li>
</ul>

<h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>

<p>• 250g beef, hand minced (chuck, brisket, short rib, shank all work)⁣<br/>
• 250g pork, hand minced (shoulder is best)⁣<br/>
• Extra Virgin Olive Oil⁣ (EVOO)<br/>
• 1 onion, diced⁣<br/>
• 1 rib celery, diced⁣<br/>
• 1 carrot, diced⁣<br/>
• 2.5 tbs tomato paste (concentrated)⁣<br/>
• 1 cup red wine⁣<br/>
• 1 cup stock (chicken or beef) + more for topping up ⁣<br/>
• 1 cup whole milk⁣<br/>
• 1 cinnamon stick⁣<br/>
• 1 bay leaf⁣</p>

<p>• a largish segment of lemon peel⁣<br/>
• A little pinch of nutmeg⁣<br/>
• Salt &amp; black pepper to taste</p>

<h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use a sharp knife or a heavy cleaver to finely chop the meat into a course mince.</li>
<li>Heat a heavy bottomed pot on high-heat add enough EVOO to cover the bottom about 1/4 inch thick then add beef and saute for 6-7 minutes until browned on the outside. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon ensuring you leave rendered fat in the pot and set aside.</li>
<li>Repeat the above step for the pork.</li>
<li>Add onions, carrot, celery and saute for 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Add red wine, then the beef and pork back in, then tomato paste, stock, milk, cinnammon, bay leaf, nutmeg, lemon peel. Give everything a good stir and season with salt (about 1 tbs) and black pepper</li>
<li>Simmer on low heat for 3-6 hours - taste every half an hour; if it gets dry top up with either water or stock. It&#39;s done when the meat is tender and no longer chewy; obviously the longer you cook the more tender/melt in your mouth it will get. </li>
</ul>

<h5>TO SERVE</h5>

<ul>
<li>Tagliatelle Egg Pasta (cook according to packet instructions and add as much ragu as you like and a dash of reserved pasta water to make it a little saucy) </li>
<li>Grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese </li>
<li>Cracked Black pepper </li>
<li>Glass of Red Wine!  </li>
</ul>
