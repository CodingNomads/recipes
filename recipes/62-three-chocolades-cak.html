            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by ladygigi</p>
            <div class="md"><p>200 gr biscuits 
80 gr butter
200 gr dark chocolade
200 gr milk chocolate
200 gr white chocolade
450 ml milk
600 ml whipping cream
3 packs (14 gr each pack) of instant gelatine (in Italy it’s trade name is tortagel, it is a gelatine powder that solidifies immediately, so that you don’t have to wait for each layer to solidify. 7 minutes that are needed for preparing each next layer are enough to solidify the previous layer).</p>

<p>So, crush buscuits and add melted butter. Distribute evenly the prepared mix into a cake form of 22 cm diameter (with a clamp, for easy opening), making so the base layer. Put in fridge 30 min.
For each chocolate layer (white, then milk, then dark): crush 200 gr of chocolate, add 150 ml of milk and 200 ml of whipping cream and one pack of tortagel, heat the mix for 7 min at 90 degrees C (I am doing it with Bimby Vorwerk kitchen appliance which allows me to maintain needed temperature during cooking). Usually 7 min should be enough for chocolate to melt and for all ingredients to mix well. Once done, pour the mix into the stamp. Repeat this step for other two layers. Let it cool in the fridge at least for 4 hours.</p>
