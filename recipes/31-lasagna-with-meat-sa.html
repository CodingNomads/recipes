            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by trevoronacob</p>
            <div class="md"><p><strong>A. Meat Sauce</strong></p>

<p>-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>

<p>-  3 large carrots, peeled <em>&amp;</em> finely chopped</p>

<p>-  1 large onion, diced</p>

<p>-  4 large cloves garlic, minced</p>

<p>-  1 green bell pepper, diced</p>

<p>-  16 ounces lean ground beef</p>

<p>-  8 ounces ground pork</p>

<p>-  ¾ cup red wine</p>

<p>-  2 cans, or fresh (28 ounces) diced tomatoes</p>

<p>- 1 tablespoon tomato paste </p>

<p>- 1/2 tablespoon ketchup </p>

<p>-  Course kosher salt (Diamond Crystal Brand) and fresh, or dried, Italian herbs (oregano, rosemary, thyme).</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<ol>
<li>In a 10 or 12 inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel or cast-iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until sufficiently pre-heated. Add onion and carrots, season slightly with a healthy pinch of kosher salt. Sauté until translucent, about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Add garlic and bell pepper. Continue cooking until garlic is fragrant but not scorched.</li>
<li>Increase heat to high. Add beef and pork and cook, breaking apart the meat with a wooden spoon until mostly browned. Approximately 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add wine and deglaze. Boil off the wine until it is mostly evaporated, 3-4 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Stir in tomatoes with all liquid if using canned. Reheat to boiling and then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
<li>Add ketchup and tomato paste </li>
<li>Season with more salt and select italian herbs to your liking. </li>
<li><p>Simmer the now mostly completed sauce, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened sufficiently.</p></li>
<li><p>Preheat oven to 375.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>B. Béchamel</strong></p>

<p>-  Metal whisk</p>

<p>-  2 tablespoons butter</p>

<p>-  3 tablespoons flour</p>

<p>-  2 cups of milk, heated to just under a boil</p>

<p>-  Salt and white pepper</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<ol>
<li>In a 2 or 3 quart saucepan, melt butter over low heat.</li>
<li>Once butter is completely melted and covering the bottom of your saucepan, blend in the flour by small amounts, stirring frequently with whisk.</li>
<li>Once all flour is blended in, continue cooking for 2 minutes without browning or coloring the mixture.</li>
<li>Remove from heat. Allow to slightly cool and then pour in the heated milk in one swift motion. Immediately and quickly blend the mixture together with whisk.</li>
<li>Return saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat and continue stirring quickly until the sauce comes to boil.</li>
<li>Boil for about 1 minute, while stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat and cling to the back of a spoon.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and season slightly with kosher salt and white pepper. Careful not to over-season as to avoid overpowering the dish.</li>
<li>If sauce is too thin, boil it down while stirring continually until reduced and thickened. If sauce is too thick, simmer and thin out with milk added in a tablespoon at a time. If sauce is lumpy, either strain or blend it and then simmer for a few minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C. Filling</strong></p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>-  1-2 cups freshly made béchamel</p>

<p>-  7 ounces, approximate, ricotta cheese</p>

<p>-  1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese.</p>

<ol>
<li>In roughly equal parts, combine all ingredients, stir well, and taste.</li>
<li>Reserve some parmesan to both top unbaked lasagna and garnish completed lasagna.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>D. Assembly</strong></p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>-  1 package (8 to 9 ounces) of no-boil lasagna noodles.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish, ladle about 1 cup of meat sauce to evenly coat the bottom of the dish.</li>
<li>Arrange 3-4 (depending on width of noodles) noodles over sauce, careful not to overlap or touch sides of the dish.</li>
<li>Ladle 1 ½ cups meat sauce over noodles.</li>
<li>Spread about ¾ - 1 cup of filling over meat sauce. Best method is to use a tablespoon, dropping dollops across the layer and then spreading slightly. The filling will loosen while cooking so it does not have to be perfect.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-4 with all remaining ingredients until you finish with a final layer of meat sauce.</li>
<li>Top assembled lasagna with filling and freshly grated parmesan.</li>
<li>Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes in preheated oven at 375.</li>
<li>Remove foil and bake for 15 additional minutes.</li>
<li>Remove dish from the oven and raise oven rack to the highest position. Set broiler to high and place uncovered lasagna on topmost rack directly under heat elements. Broil carefully, with over door ajar, until the top is perfectly crisped and brown.</li>
<li>Turn off heat, remove from oven and rest for a minimum of 15 minutes.</li>
<li>With a serrated knife, divide lasagna into equal portions and guide your cuts by the small gaps between noodles.</li>
<li>Serve garnished with fresh chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Pair with peperoncinis and the rest of that bottle of red wine.</li>
