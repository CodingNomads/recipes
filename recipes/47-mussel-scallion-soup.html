            <div class="md"><p>Ingredients:
1. 1 bottle white cooking wine - 12.7 fl oz
2. 1 yellow onion, coursely chopped 
3. Red pepper flakes, measured with your heart
4. Pinch smoked paprika 
5. Pinch dill weed
6. Sprig Thyme
7. Bay leaf 
8. 3.5 lb fresh mussels, debearded in shell
9. 3 tbsp butter
10. 1 thick bunch scallions, white and greens chopped separately
11. 1 tsp minced garlic (from the jar)
12. 14.5 oz can whole tomatoes, steam peeled 
13. 1 cup heavy cream
14. Sprinkle Parmesan
15. Freshly ground black pepper</p>

<p>Directions: 
 1. Add your wine, onions, thyme, bay leaf, dill weed, paprika and red pepper flakes to a medium/large pot. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes. 
2. Add your mussels to the pot, cover again, and let them steam for about 10 minutes, until they’re fully opened. 
3. Strain the muscles into a colander and deshell them into a bowl. While you’re doing this, let the wine mussel broth rest so that all of the grit remains at the bottom. 
4. Melt your butter into another medium-large pot, add the garlic and white parts of your scallions - cook until soft. 
5. Add your tomatoes and all liquid from the can, crushing the tomatoes by hand as you put them in the pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes.
Now add the broth, pouring carefully and slowly - you’ll see the bits of grit at the bottom, staying in the broth pot. 
6. Add your cream, and simmer for another 10 minutes.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add your mussels and scallion greens and cook for another 4 minutes until mussels are heated all the way through.
8. Sprinkle a bit of Parmesan and black pepper if you’d like, warm up and butter a baguette for dipping, and enjoy! </p>
