<ul>
<li>1/4 cup (50 ml) Water ( might have to add more)</li>
<li>2 Cup (250g) Flour</li>
<li>3 Eggs</li>
<li>1tsp (5g) Salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ingredients Fried Onions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1-2 Cups Vegetable Oil</li>
<li>1/2 Onion</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ingredients Cheese Spaetzle</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>12-14 Oz (340- 400 g) Strong flavored Cheese (le Gruyere, Strong Cheddar,...)</li>
<li>4 Slices of Bacon</li>
<li>1/2 Onion</li>
<li>1/4-1/2Cup  Heavy Cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Broil for 5 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Directions Spaetzle</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Mix all dry ingredient together</li>
<li>Add liquid ingredients</li>
<li>Knead the dough for around 10-12 minutes, with a wooden spoon until the dough gets smooth and you can see some big bubbles.</li>
<li>let the dough rest in a bowl covered with some plastic wrap for at least 30 min.</li>
<li>Boil one big pot of salt water</li>
<li>Use your spaetzle tool and form the spaetzle. Pusher for short round Spaetzle, Board for long and thin Spaetzle -&gt; check out the tutorial clip linked at the bottom</li>
<li>Boil it for 3-5 minutes, drain them and put them aside</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Directions Fried Onions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the onion into small slices, I recommend using a mandolin</li>
<li>Boil the onions in salted water for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Drain and dry them afterwards</li>
<li>Fry the Onions in Vegetable oil for 5 minutes or until they are lightly brown.</li>
<li>Put them on paper twol and let the access fat drip off.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Directions Cheese Spaetzle</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the Bacon slices into small stripes and roast them for a few minutes before you add the 1/2 diced onion to the pan ( I recommend using a cast iron pan)</li>
<li>After the Onions are soft and the bacon is almost crispy you are going to add some butter and the spaetzle. Saute it for a few minutes until the access water is gone.</li>
<li>Slowly add the Cheese in several batches. As oosn as the first batch is melted add the heavy cream to the speatzle. As soon as it is incorporated nicely add the left over cheese.</li>
<li>Stir frequently until everything i smelted and nicely combined.</li>
<li>Depending on the cheese you used, you might have to season the Spaetzle as well ( salt, Peper, Nutmeg...) whatever you like</li>
<li>Put the pan into the broiler for 5 minutes until golden brown</li>
<li>Topp it off with the crispy onions</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your homemade Spaetzle</p>
