<p>Did you know that the tradition wants that a charm (fÃªve) is hidden in the cake (galette) and the one that finds it assigns her king or his queen for the day and kisses!</p>

<p><strong><em>If youâ€™d like to learn a little more about the tradition and a little french in process check out my fiancÃ© and I in this:</em></strong><br/>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br/>
* 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>
* Â½ cup (60 grams) powdered sugar<br/>
* Â¾ cup (85 grams) almond flour<br/>
* Â¼ teaspoon salt<br/>
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br/>
* Zest of 1 meyer lemon<br/>
* 1 tsp pure almond extract<br/>
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract<br/>
* 1 tablespoon rum (optional)<br/>
* 2 frozen puff pastry sheets (14- to 17-ounce package; 396-482 grams), cut into two 9 in circles, cold 
* 1 feve (if you dont have a small charm, you can use a whole almond or dried bean instead)  </p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong><br/>
To make the filling</p>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the almond flour and the salt. Mix in 1 whole egg, then the white from the second egg (reserve the yolk). Mix in the rum, if using, and the vanilla and almond extracts. Spoon into a piping bag or just cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 
Mix the yolk with 1 teaspoon cold water; cover, and refrigerate until needed.   </p>

<p><strong>To assemble:</strong></p>

<p>Place one circle of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pipe or spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border bare. Press the charm into the filling. Moisten the border with cold water, position the second circle of dough over the filling and press around the border with your fingertips or the rim of a bowl to seal well. Using the back of a table knife, scallop the edges by pushing into the dough (about 1/4- to 1/2-inch deep) every 1/2 inch or so. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  </p>

<p>Heat the oven to 425 F. Brush a thin layer of the reserved yolk glaze over the top of the galette, avoiding the border. With the point of a knife, etch a design into the top of the galette, taking care not to pierce the dough. Cut 6 small slits in the top as steam vents.  </p>

<p>Turn the heat down to 400 F, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the galette is puffed and deeply golden. Check after 20 minutes, and tent loosely with foil if itâ€™s browning too much or too fast. Transfer to a rack, and cool for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
