            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by HELLO_DARKNESS_REDIT</p>
            <div class="md"><p>ingredients：</p>

<p>all purpose flour 400g</p>

<p>sugar 12g 1 tablespoon</p>

<p>salt 1g 1/8 teaspoon</p>

<p>boiling water 83g 1/3 cup</p>

<p>warm milk (about 35 °C) 167g 2/3 cup (reduce the milk amount by 15-30g, if you live in a humid place)</p>

<p>yeast 3g 1 teaspoon</p>

<p>large eggs 2</p>

<p>oil 24g</p>

<p>for egg wash:</p>

<p>1 egg</p>

<p>1 tablespoon milk</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon confectioners sugar</p>

<p>small pinch salt</p>

<p>Method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by combining flour, sugar and salt together. Mix with a spatula. Add boiling water and slowly incorporate</li>
<li>now microwave some cold milk for 30 seconds. add yeast and mix. pour into the flour and water mixture. add eggs and mix. the dough should be very sticky. DO NOT add more flour. Rest for 20 mins with a lid on</li>
<li>after you have rested add oil. Oil should make the dough no sticky. Knead the dough until the oil in incorporated and it is sticky again. Cover and rest for 1 hour.</li>
<li>after one hour, punch the dough with floured hands until you have let most of the air out. It should be about the size of the dough before resting. Now, split into three pieces. flour a surface and roll it out. fold both ways in. then, smooth side down, roll it out with a pin. With your hands, roll it into a roll ( sorry, is this confusing?) and place into a prepared bread tin. This is optional. If you want to just place all the pieces into the bread tin. but doing that will help the bread have more layers and fluffiness. rest in bread tin for 1 hour.</li>
<li>now, make your egg wash by combing all ingredients and mixi with a whisk. using a brush bush a thin layer on. cook at 190C for 30 mins. take out and cool for 5 mins.. You can split them open with your hands or cut with a knife. Enjoy!!!</li>
