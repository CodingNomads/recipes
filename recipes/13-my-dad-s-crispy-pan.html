            <div class="md"><p>Excited to share a dish I grew up with! </p>

<p>The salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that’s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKlH4K1ANA&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s">video</a> for a walkthrough.</p>

<h1>Sourcing Salmon Sustainably</h1>

<p>For this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there’s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed. </p>

<p>As one of the world’s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way. </p>

<p>As consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called &quot;Seafood Watch&quot; which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.</p>

<h1>Salmon + Chinese communities in the west</h1>

<p>As I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.</p>

<p>During the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the Gām Sāan, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination. </p>

<p>Undeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world. </p>

<p>During and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world’s salmon at the time.</p>

<p>Today, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.</p>

<h2>THE RECIPE</h2>

<p>Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>Prep Time: 10 min</li>
<li>Total Time: 25 min</li>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
</ul>

<p>Ingredients for Salmon</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 lb <strong>salmon</strong></li>
<li>1 <strong>egg</strong></li>
<li><strong>white pepper</strong> (to taste)</li>
<li>3 tbsp <strong>cornstarch</strong></li>
<li>2 tbsp <strong>corn oil</strong></li>
<li>0.50 tbsp <strong>rice cooking wine</strong></li>
<li><strong>garlic salt</strong> (to taste)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dipping Sauce</p>

<ul>
<li>1 tbsp <strong>sugar</strong></li>
<li>0.50 tbsp <strong>vinegar</strong></li>
<li>2 tbsp <strong>light soy sauce</strong></li>
<li>0.25 tsp <strong>chili sauce</strong> (to taste)</li>
<li>2 tbsp <strong>boiling water</strong> (very important)</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional Garnish</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>cilantro</strong></li>
<li><strong>broccoli</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Step 1 - Cut salmon</h1>

<p>This is totally optional, but if you&#39;re planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it&#39;s best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).</p>

<p>To make our <strong>salmon</strong> (1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.</p>

<h1>Step 2 - Coat salmon</h1>

<p>Spread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle <strong>white pepper</strong> on each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the &quot;fishy&quot; taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll crack and mix our <strong>egg(s)</strong> (1) into a bowl, and spread out <strong>cornstarch</strong> (3 tbsp) on a plate.</p>

<p>Coat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.</p>

<p>This coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy/crispiness when it&#39;s cooked.</p>

<h1>Step 3 - Cook salmon</h1>

<p><strong>Heating the wok</strong></p>

<p>We’ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.</p>

<p>Unlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it’s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It’s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.</p>

<p>My dad relies on his own intuition that he’s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.</p>

<p><strong>Cook the salmon</strong>Then, we’ll add <strong>corn oil</strong> (2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.</p>

<p>The wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.</p>

<p>Once this happens, we’ll add our salmon to the wok.</p>

<p>My dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.</p>

<p>The total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you’re using.</p>

<p>On my dad’s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.</p>

<p>For a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white / yellow-ish, you can flip it.</p>

<p>You should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.</p>

<p><strong>Other tips</strong></p>

<p>As long as it’s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that’s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that’s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Kenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it’s still a great resource, and I’ve linked to it in our description.</p>

<h1>Step 4 - Add flavors, cover wok</h1>

<p>Add <strong>garlic salt</strong> to the fillets.</p>

<p>Then, we&#39;ll add <strong>rice cooking wine</strong> (0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we’ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We’ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.</p>

<h1>Step 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish</h1>

<p>Uncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you&#39;d like.</p>

<h1>Step 6 - Create sauce</h1>

<p>To make the sauce, mix together <strong>sugar</strong> (1 tbsp), <strong>vinegar</strong> (0.50 tbsp), <strong>light soy sauce</strong> (2 tbsp), <strong>boiling water</strong> (2 tbsp), and <strong>chili sauce</strong> (0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.</li>
<li>If you’re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it’s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our &quot;Meal Time&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Our why</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad&#39;s perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)</p>
