            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by MrJim911</p>
            <div class="md"><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, finely diced</li>
<li>21 oz (600 g) mushrooms, washed and dried with paper      towel (I used Cremini)</li>
<li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup white wine, (OPTIONAL) (I substituted with      chicken broth)</li>
<li>5 oz (150 g) jarred sun dried tomato strips in oil, (reserve      1 tablespoon of the jarred oil for cooking)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste (I did not add any salt or      pepper)</li>
<li>3 cups baby spinach leaves, washed</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cornstarch, OPTIONAL — (mix cornstarch with      1 tablespoon water for a thicker sauce.</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (I used dried      parsley)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt the butter and sauté onion until transparent; add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about one minute). Cook the sun dried tomatoes and oil in with the butter for about 2 minutes to release all of their flavours. Cook mushrooms in the tomato flavours for about 5 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour in the white wine or broth (if using), and allow to reduce to half, while scraping any bits off of the bottom of the pan. (SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU WISH.)</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the cream and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in the spinach leaves; allow to wilt in the sauce, then add in the parmesan cheese. Allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the sauce. (For a thicker sauce, add the milk/cornstarch mixture to the center of the pan, and continue to simmer while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens.)</p></li>
<li><p>Mix in the herbs and garnish with parsley. </p></li>
<li><p>Serve over mashed cauliflower, zucchini noodles or steamed veg. Alternatively, serve over pasta, mashed potatoes or rice.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that I’ve made this dish, I think boiling some gnocchi and adding it in at the end would be amazing. The sauce would also be great for dipping some fresh bread in.</p>
