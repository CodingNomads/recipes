<p>Servings: 12</p>

<p>Equipment: Blender, spring form pan, rubber spatula, pallet knife, whisk.</p>

<p>Prep Time: 1.5 hours</p>

<p>Cook Time: 3 hours</p>

<p>Chill Time: 9 hours</p>

<p>Total Time: 13.5 hours</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients for Coffee Cheese Filling:</strong></p>

<p>2 250g bricks Cream Cheese, very soft.</p>

<p>250g or 1 cup Yogurt</p>

<p>60mL or 1/4 cup Whole Milk</p>

<p>5 tbsp Evaporated Milk or Heavy Cream</p>

<p>2 Whole Eggs</p>

<p>135g or 2/3 cup Sugar</p>

<p>2 tsp Instant Coffee Powder, sifted</p>

<p>75g or 1/4 cup Condensed Milk</p>

<p>2 tsp Vanilla Extract or Paste</p>

<p>Boiling water for water bath</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients for Vanilla Sponge</strong></p>

<p>120g or 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter</p>

<p>200g or 1 cup Sugar</p>

<p>4 Whole Eggs</p>

<p>4 tbsp Milk Powder or Evaporated Milk</p>

<p>6 oz White Chocolate</p>

<p>125g or 1 cup All Purpose Flour</p>

<p>1/2 tsp Baking Powder</p>

<p>1/2 tsp Salt</p>

<p><strong>Cake Preparation</strong></p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350F/175C.</p>

<p>Grease the sides of a round 9-inch Spring form pan with butter.</p>

<p>Melt chocolate and butter together.</p>

<p>Take off heat and mix in sugar and milk powder/evaporated milk.</p>

<p>Add eggs one at a time and fold together.</p>

<p>Sift in baking powder, salt, and flour, mix together well. </p>

<p>Pour into pan and bake for about 40-45 minutes or until skewer inserted comes out clean.</p>

<p>The top of the cake will dome and turn a nice golden brown color.</p>

<p>Let the cake cool and then trim the top to flatten it. </p>

<p><strong>Coffee Cheesecake Filling Prep</strong></p>

<p>Cool oven to 320F/160C. Bring a kettle of water to a boil, this is for the water bath.</p>

<p>Wrap the bottom of the cake pan with foil, it’s best if you wrap it multiple times to ensure a nice waterproof seal.</p>

<p>Soften cream cheese by microwaving for 45 seconds and then place in blender.</p>

<p>Blend cheese, yogurt, and all the milks together(condensed, whole, and evaporated/cream) until smooth.</p>

<p>Add in eggs, sugar, vanilla, and coffee then blend together well. Make sure you scrape down the blender sides to ensure no lumps are present.</p>

<p>Pour cheesecake filling onto vanilla sponge and place pan in water bath. You want to pour enough water around the pan that it covers half of it. Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes then turn off the oven and bake for an additional 45 minutes. The center will be a little jiggly, that’s okay. </p>

<p>Remove from oven and run a pallet knife around the edge to release cake from the pan. </p>

<p>Let it cool for 1 hour on the counter before chilling in the fridge for at least 6 hours. Overnight is ideal but 6-7 hours will work in a pinch. </p>

<p>Before cutting,  run a knife under hot water and then wipe it dry. This will help you to get a nice clean cut.</p>

<p>Serve with fruits or a dollop of whipped cream up top.</p>
