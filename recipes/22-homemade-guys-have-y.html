            <div class="md"><p>Instructions</p>

<p>Heat a deep, large skillet or sautÃ© pan on medium. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, sautÃ© for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to sautÃ© till mixture is fragrant. Â Â </p>

<p>Add the diced bell pepper, sautÃ© for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.</p>

<p>Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir until blended. Add spices and sugar, stir, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce.Â </p>

<p>At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!).</p>

<p>Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook &quot;over easy&quot; style on top of the tomato sauce.</p>

<p>Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn&#39;t reduce too much, which can lead to burning.</p>

<p>Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.Â Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired.</p>

<p>Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if you are gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.</p>

<p>( A good thing to do if pepper give you stomach pain and it works for me everytime it&#39;s to roast them in the oven for 25 min then place them in a bowl cover with cling film for 10 min ! They will sweat and you will be able to peel the skin off so easily ! Trust me this will peel just like a banana haha ! Then it&#39;s easier to digest this beauty ! Hope this help have a good day everyone )</p>
