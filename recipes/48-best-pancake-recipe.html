            <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve tried a lot of pancake recipes but I think this is by far the best one yet, itâ€™s super fluffy and soft and delicious ðŸ˜‹ </p>

<p>This is the recipe that I used that I found on youtube, but modified one or two things:</p>

<p>210g of flour,
50g of sugar,
12g of baking powder,
3g of salt,
2 eggs,
240ml of milk,
5ml of vanilla extract,
Sunflower oil (I usually just add like two teaspoons of that to the mixture and then add a little bit to the pan for the first pancake and wipe the excess with a paper towel).</p>

<p>And this the video that explains how to make it and contains the original recipe which is pretty much the same: </p>
