            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by josephine9292</p>
            <div class="md"><p><strong>INGREDIENTS: (2 servings)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>4 large prawns (whole)</li>
<li>150g squid (cleaned)</li>
<li>2 stalks of lemongrass</li>
<li>1 knob of galangal (blue ginger)</li>
<li>6-7 Kaffir lime leaves</li>
<li>3-4 Thai chilies</li>
<li>1 medium shallot</li>
<li>1 medium tomato</li>
<li>5-6 large oyster mushrooms</li>
<li>1 litre of water</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SEASONINGS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2.5 tbs Thai red chili paste</li>
<li>1.5 tbs sugar, 6-7 tbs fresh lime juice</li>
<li>3 tbs fish sauce</li>
<li>40ml evaporated milk </li>
<li>Adjust the ratio accordingly, due to the different level of saltiness and sweetness of the chili paste &amp; fish sauce</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are lactose intolerant and still would like to have a little bit of creaminess in the soup, you can use coconut milk or other plant milk. However, they will impart some different flavours in this soup. Or, you can just skip the milk!</li>
<li>The herbs are used to add flavours in the soup. Don&#39;t eat them as they are very fibrous! </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove heads and shells of the prawn, then devein them.</li>
<li>Cut squid into bite sized pieces</li>
<li>Optional: to make them look nicer, make shallow crisscross cuts on the inside of the squid pieces.</li>
<li>In a pot, add 1tbs of oil, fry the heads and shells, press them using a potato smasher to further extract the juice from the heads.</li>
<li>Add 1 litre of water and let simmer on low heat for 25 minutes</li>
<li>Use the back of the knife to bruise lemongrass stalks, then slice them diagonally</li>
<li>Slice galangal/blue ginger into thick slices</li>
<li>Slightly break up/tear the kaffir lime leaves</li>
<li>Bruise chili and cut them into halves</li>
<li>Slice shallot into small wedges</li>
<li>Slice tomato into chunks</li>
<li>Break oyster mushrooms into medium pieces</li>
<li>After 25 minutes, remove prawnâ€™s heads and shells</li>
<li>Add lemongrass, galangal, chili and kaffir lime leaves. Simmer for 5 mins</li>
<li>Add fish sauce, sugar, and Thai red chili paste. Stir well to dissolve</li>
<li>Add shallot, tomato, mushrooms. Stir well</li>
<li>Add squid, stir and when it is almost cooked, add prawns</li>
<li>Add milk, make sure to use low heat. When everything is cooked, taste and check the level of saltiness and sweetness. Remove from heat.</li>
<li>Keep stirring gently to slightly bring down the temperature of the soup, then add lime juice and mix well. Always add lime juice last, otherwise it will turn bitter if cooked.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnish with cilantro. It can be eaten on its own, or with steamed Jasmine rice. Enjoy!</li>
