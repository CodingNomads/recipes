<p>Recipe (10 servings: 50-100 wontons)</p>

<ul>
<li>Ginger (3 slices)</li>
<li>Scallion (1 large)</li>
<li>Chinese Celery (5 small stalks)</li>
<li>Yellow Chives (large bunch)</li>
<li>Shrimp (1 pound)</li>
<li>Ground Pork Fat (1/4 pound)</li>
<li>Salt, White Pepper, Chicken Stock (1/2tsp)</li>
<li>Sesame oil (a touch)</li>
<li>Egg (1)</li>
<li>Corn starch (1 tsp)</li>
<li>Wonton Wrappers (50-100)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Prep the ingredients: finely mince the ginger and scallions, roughly mince the celery and rough dice the yellow chives. Clean the shrimp by cutting the top half and washing in a sink, then smash them and roughly dice.</li>
<li>Throw shrimp into a mixing bowl and add one egg white along with the ginger/scallions. Using a claw shape, mix this until sticky. Add the pork fat and continue to mix until paste-like and sticky. Pick up the mixture and throw it into the bowl, this will tenderize the meat very well.</li>
<li>Add in the chives/celery and also some sesame oil and corn starch. At this point mix very gently to prevent damaging any of the vegetables, transfer to a smaller bowl for wrapping.</li>
<li>Wrap the wontons using a small butter knife, and egg yolk as a glue.(I wish I could post short videos on here so I could show you the actual technique on how to wrap them up. But I have a very good guide on my youtube video, so check it out if you need visual representation :)</li>
<li>You can steam or boil the wontons for 6-9 minutes. Steaming will give you a more tender consistency but is optional.... and DONE!</li>
</ol>

<p>Sichuan Spicy Sauce (2 servings, use more as needed)</p>

<ul>
<li>Garlic (2 cloves)</li>
<li>Ginger (3 slices)</li>
<li>Scallions (1 large)</li>
<li>Bao Bei Chili Oil (4 tbl)</li>
<li>Soy paste (1.5 tbl)</li>
<li>Sugar (1/2 tsp)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Mince everything very well and add in sauces.. mix. Drizzle as much as you want on top of freshly cooked wontons and garnish with scallions.</li>
</ol>
