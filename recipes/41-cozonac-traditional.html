            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by ShortcakeRoyale</p>
            <div class="md"><p>The &quot;cozonac&quot; is found everywhere in Romania - it&#39;s made every time we&#39;re celebrating something important, such as Christmas.</p>

<p>The ones I made here are filled with a walnut and cocoa paste, flavored with vanilla and rum essence. Other varieties exist, such as the very popular turkish delight cozonac.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a difficult dough to knead by hand because it requires lots of effort and strong arms. I&#39;d rather not attempt it without a stand mixer but that is up to you. The short story is: you want to knead it until you&#39;re able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn&#39;t break.</p>

<p>Here is a video version of the recipe, which should help especially when it comes to rolling the cozonac. It&#39;s in Romanian but I translated the steps.</p>

<p>Ingredients for two small or a single large cozonac:</p>

<p><em>For the dough:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>500 to 550 grams of flour (I used &quot;000&quot; flour which I think is equivalent to &quot;pastry flour&quot;)</li>
<li>250ml milk</li>
<li>8 egg yolks (size M)</li>
<li>100g powdered sugar</li>
<li>25g granulated sugar</li>
<li>25g fresh yeast (or the equivalent dry yeast, as indicated on the package)</li>
<li>100g butter</li>
<li>25ml oil with neutral taste (such as refined sunflower oil - note that unrefined sunflower oil does carry taste and smell)</li>
<li>1 tbsp rum essence</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla essence</li>
<li>the zest of a lemon, a similarly sized orange or a combination of the two</li>
<li>a good pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For the walnut filling:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>350g crushed walnuts, I like them very finely crushed but you can leave some chunks in if you want</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>200g granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 tbsp cocoa powder (I used dark cocoa powder)</li>
<li>1 tbsp rum essence</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla essence</li>
<li>2 egg whites (size M)</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ll need some oil, a yolk or two and some milk for finishing as well.</p>

<p>Steps (dough):</p>

<ol>
<li>Place 50g of the flour in a bowl, and get 100ml of milk boiling. Once boiling, pour it over the flour and mix well. Take 25g of yeast and 25g of granulated sugar and beat them together until you get a liquid. You can do this in the same bowl if you&#39;re sure the yeast won&#39;t touch the hot flour paste. Wait until the flour paste has cooled down and then combine the two together, spread some flour on top, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until it&#39;s doubled in size. This will be our &quot;scalded starter mix&quot;.</li>
<li>Once that&#39;s done, place the remaining flour in your stand mixer&#39;s bowl, together with the lemon/orange zest. Mix on the lowest speed, just to combine.</li>
<li>Beat the egg yolks with a good pinch of salt, the oil, the rum and vanilla essences and then mix with 150ml of lukewarm or room temperature milk.</li>
<li>Add the liquid mixture obtained above to the stand mixer bowl, together with the scalded starter mix that should&#39;ve risen by now. Turn on the stand mixer on low at first, and gradually increase the speed to a medium-high, until all ingredients are completely combined.</li>
<li>Keep mixing, add the powdered sugar, half of it at a time.</li>
<li>Once the powdered sugar has been added, continue mixing on a high speed for another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>You may need, every now and then, to stop the mixer and scrape the dough from the bowl and the attachment. This dough is very very sticky. At the end we&#39;ll cover our table in oil and the thing will most likely still stick to it in some places.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes it&#39;s time to add the butter, in small chunks. Don&#39;t add the next chunk until the previous is completely incorporated.</li>
<li>Once the butter has been completely incorporated, keep mixing at high speed for another 15 minutes. Unless you&#39;ve chosen to do it by hand, in which case you&#39;ll have to give the dough a real good smashing for 45 whole minutes. You&#39;re pretty badass if you chose this route, not gonna lie.</li>
<li>Remember the doneness test: you want to knead it until you&#39;re able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn&#39;t break.</li>
</ol>

<p>Place the dough in a bowl that&#39;s been greased with oil, cover with a towel, and let to rise until doubled in size in a warm place.</p>

<p>Steps (filling):</p>

<ol>
<li>Place the crushed walnuts in a bowl.</li>
<li>Bring 100ml of milk and 200g granulated sugar to a boil, mixing continuously to dissolve the sugar properly.</li>
<li>Pour the hot milk &amp; sugar mixture onto the walnuts and mix well.</li>
<li>Add the cocoa powder, vanilla and rum essences, the two egg whites, and mix again. Some people choose to beat the egg whites first, I added them as they came out of the egg. Works either way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Final steps (refer to the video I linked above to best get these steps right):</p>

<ol>
<li>The dough should&#39;ve risen by now. Spread some oil on your working surface, take the dough out of the bowl and spread it into a rectangular shape that&#39;s fairly thin. You can do this by hand because the dough is extremely easy to shape.</li>
<li>If you want to make two portions, cut the rectangle in two. Once rolled, the dough should fit in your rectangular loaf tins so keep this in mind.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with the walnut filling, leaving out a couple of centimeters around the filling to help with the rolling.</li>
<li>Roll from top to bottom, constantly bringing the sides of the rectangle towards the inside.</li>
<li>Make sure you&#39;ve rolled it well and securely sealed it.</li>
<li>Place a baking sheet in your pan, making sure to cover the sides properly, then very carefully place the rolled up cozonac in it. Careful, it&#39;s fragile, so get your fingers underneath it from the get-go.</li>
<li>Beat an egg yolk with a tablespoon or two of milk, and carefully brush the surface of the cozonac.</li>
<li>Let it sit covered in a warm place for 45 mins or so, or until it increased in size and reached the top of the pan.</li>
<li>In the meantime, preheat your oven to 190 degrees celsius.</li>
<li>Get the cozonac in the oven, and let it bake for about 10 minutes, at which point you want to cover it with aluminium foil and bake for another 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Take out of the oven, let cool down a bit in the tin, then take them out and let cool further on a rack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Normally you don&#39;t cut into them until they&#39;re completely cooled, but rules are made to be broken. I like to eat pieces of the crust while it&#39;s still hot. Enjoy!</p>
