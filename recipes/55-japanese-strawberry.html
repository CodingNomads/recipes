<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>140g egg whites</li>
<li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
<li>50g sugar</li>
<li>70g egg yolk</li>
<li>55g flour</li>
<li>15g cornstarch</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>45g milk</li>
<li>45g oil</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 large strawberries, sliced</li>
<li>200g heavy whipping cream</li>
<li>15g sugar</li>
<li>5g vanilla pudding powder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 340F. Line a 9 inch x 9 inch cake pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Add lemon juice to the egg whites and beat on medium speed until thick and foamy. Gradually add in 50g sugar and continue beating until meringue reaches stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Whisk the egg yolks lightly to break them, then pour into the meringue and gently fold with a whisk until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Sift in the flour, cornstarch and salt. Gently fold with whisk until no lumps remain.</li>
<li>Add the milk, oil and vanilla extract, again folding in with a whisk.</li>
<li>Use a spatula to fold the batter one more time, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
<li>Slowly pour the batter into the lined pan. Smooth out the top with the spatula, then run a toothpick through the batter to remove air bubbles. Carefully bang the pan a few times on the counter to remove any remaining air pockets.</li>
<li>Bake at 340F for 25 minutes until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove from pan and let cool completely before icing.</li>
<li>To make the whipped cream icing, beat heavy whipping cream with sugar on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Add the instant pudding powder and beat for another 30 seconds to incorporate.</li>
<li>Cut the cake in half and spread a thing layer of whipped cream evenly (about 1/4 of the total cream) over one half. Place the strawberry slices on top, pressing them down into the cream a little. Spread more cream over the top so that strawberries are completely covered.</li>
<li>Gently place the other half of cake on top. Cover with the remaining whipped cream.</li>
<li>Chill the cake for about an hour to help set the cream and create a cleaner cross section. Trim off the edges with a sharp knife and decorate the top with halved strawberries.</li>
