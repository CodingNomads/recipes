            <div class="md"><p>Chocolate Crinkles cookies:</p>

<p>1/2 cup I bleached AP flour (I used King Arthur’s)
1/4 cup Dutch price eased cocoa powder 
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate ( I used semi sweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup sugar ( I used bakers sugar, super fine and found it at Safeway)
1/4 cup powdered sugar</p>

<p>Preheat over to 325 degrees
In medium bowl sift and whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</p>

<p>In a large bowl, whisk brown sugar egg, yolk and vanilla until combined.</p>

<p>Melt chocolate chips and butter in microwave until melted (I did two times 30 sec) use rubber spatula to stir chocolate mixture until we’ll combine and shiny.</p>

<p>Add chocolate mixture to  brown sugar mixture use a spatula until well combined, then add flour mixture until no more flour is visible. Let dough sit at room temp for 10 min.</p>

<p>Place sugar in a shallow dish and powdered sugar in a another shallow dish.</p>

<p>(For this part I used a ice cream scooper) 
Use your hands to Roll the dough into 12 balls ( about two table spoons) drop balls directly in sugar and roll to coat then transfer the balls to into the dish with powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Place dough balls on parchment  lined baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between.</p>

<p>Bake cookies until puffed and cracked. Edges have begin to set but center is still soft 11 min.</p>

<p>Leave to cool for 30 min and enjoy! They are soooo good!</p>
