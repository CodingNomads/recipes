            <div class="md"><p>Who doesn&#39;t like super crunchy shortbreads that melt in the mouth? Quick in preparation with a cool shape that will surprise your friends and family.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get mixer going!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients (makes around 18 cookies):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>220g butter in room temperature</li>
<li>80g caster sugar</li>
<li>1/2tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>250g plain flour</li>
<li>100g of milk chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Cream <strong>butter</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> until white and fluffy, this should take around <strong>3-4 minutes</strong>.(I recommend to use a stand mixer or hand-held mixer with a bowl)</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Add <strong>250g of plain flour</strong>, <strong>1/2tsp of vanilla bean paste</strong> and <strong>pinch of salt</strong>. Mix ingredients together with a spatula until the dough starts to form (do not use mixer anymore!)</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Mix in the <strong>chocolate chips</strong> and transfer the dough on to a sheet of baking paper, cover the dough with another sheet and roll the dough flat to <strong>half-inch</strong> thick.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Transfer flattened dough with both sheets of paper onto a wooden board and place in the freezer for <strong>20 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> When ready, remove the dough from the freezer and cut out triangles with a sharp knife, place triangles on the two trays with baking paper (dough will be hard but not frozen at this point).</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Once all shortbreads are cut out, place them back in the freezer for <strong>5 minutes</strong> and preheat the oven to <strong>165C (329F)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Bake shortbreads for <strong>18 minutes</strong> or until edges start to turn golden brown. (If using two trays, swap them places half-way through)</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Once baked remove tray from the oven and leave on the side for <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> then transfer cookies onto a cooling rack.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Enjoy with a cuppa!</p>
