<p>INGREDIENTS:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Donuts dough:</em></li>
<li>500 gr flour</li>
<li>200 ml warm milk</li>
<li>70 gr butter (room temperature)</li>
<li>2 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
<li>10 gr dry yeast</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li><em>Topping:</em></li>
<li>100 gr dark chocolate</li>
<li>100 gr dark chocolate</li>
<li>200 gr heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>

<h2>DONUTS:</h2>

<p>In a small bowl, mix the yeast with a little bit of warm water to dissolve it.</p>

<p>Put the flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the center then add: the yeast mixture, eggs, vanilla extract, salt, butter and mix using a spoon or your hands. Add the milk little at a time, then knead the dough for several minutes until it is soft and detaches from the sides of the bowl. Cover with a towel and let it rise for at least 1 hour.</p>

<p>Flour a work surface to roll out the dough, then using a glass or round cutter, cut out donuts. Cover with a towel and set aside for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Fry your donuts in heated vegetable or any other frying oil and set in a blotting paper to absorb oil.</p>

<h2>TOPPING:</h2>

<p>I choose to top my donuts with white chocolate ganache, and dark chocolate ganache.</p>

<p>In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it barely begins to simmer. In the meantime, place each chocolate separately in a heat proof bowl after chopping it (the smaller the chocolate pieces are the easier it is to melt). When the cream starts to simmer, pour half of it in each chocolate bowl, let it sit for 2 minutes then stir very slowly until well combined.</p>

<p>Dip the donuts in one of the ganaches, sprinkle with anything you have, like m&amp;ms or any small candies.</p>

<p>Let the donuts dry for 1 hour before tasting.</p>
