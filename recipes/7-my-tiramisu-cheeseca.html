            <div class="md"><p>I messed up a bit at the heart shape there, a bit frustrated about it but don&#39;t mind too much because the end result was just too tasty. I like this more than tiramisu or cheesecake on their own.</p>

<p>The recipe in text form, originally written by <a href="/u/italian_cook">/u/italian_cook</a> (link to original post and video at the end of this comment)</p>

<p>Ingredients :</p>

<ul>
<li>500 gr mascarpone (1.1 pound)</li>
<li>100 gr heavy cream ( 3.53 ounce )</li>
<li>130 gr sugar ( 4.59 ounce )</li>
<li>300 gr savoiardi (10.58 ounce )</li>
<li>250 gr coffee (8.82 ounce )</li>
<li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>250 gr cream cheese (8.82 ounce )</li>
<li>10 gr  gelatin ( 0.35 ounce ) 1</li>
<li>100 gr butter ( 3.53 ounce )</li>
<li>6 EGGS</li>
</ul>

<p>----------- How to make a Savoiardi Crust ------------------</p>

<ul>
<li>Take  190 gr ( 6.7 ounce ) of savoiardi and put them in a plastic food bag  and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. transfer the crumbs to a  bowl</li>
<li>take 100 gr (3.53 ounce) of butter, put it in a saucepan and melt it</li>
<li>once the butter is well melted put it in the savoiardi&#39;s crumbs, add 50 gr ( 1.76 ounce ) of coffee too and mix well</li>
<li>Press  the mixture into the bottom of an 20 cm (8 inch) springform pan, you  can put a cake collar in it now. Chill in fridge until firm, normally 40  minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>----------- How to Mascarpone  Cream  ---------------</p>

<ul>
<li>separate the egg yolks from the egg whites</li>
<li>put the gelatin in abundant water for at least 10 minutes until is soft</li>
<li>in  a mixing bowl put the yolk and begin to work it with an electric whisk  if you are not sure of the freshness and quality of the eggs you can  always pasteurize the eggs ( see*)</li>
<li>add 1/2 of sugar at the time and let the yolks absorb it</li>
<li>work the yolks until they change color</li>
<li>add the mascarpone a little at the time beating with an electric whisk until it becomes smooth.</li>
<li>Repeat the operation with the cream cheese</li>
<li>put  the heavy cream in a saucepan, warm it on low heat and put the gelatin  well drained from the water. Mix until the gelatin is well melted in the  heavy cream</li>
<li>Add the heavy cream at the mixture a little at the time and continue to beat until the batter is creamy and smooth</li>
</ul>

<p>------------ Assembly-------------------------</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut the remaining savoiardi in half</li>
<li>take the springform pan from the fridge and pour half of the cream cheese mixture</li>
<li>Soak  the savoiardi in the cold coffee for a few moments and distributed it  on the cream pressing gently until you obtain a layer  pour another  quarter of the cream.</li>
<li>can  happen that the savoiardi will rise a little, don&#39;t panic. Put the cake  in the fridge  for 20 minutes then press a little the savoiardi in the  cream.</li>
<li>Finally cover with the remaining cream cheese mixture  put the springform pan in fridge for at least 3 hour.</li>
<li>take off the cake collar and using a strainer dust the cheesecake with a dense layer of unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s  all!  if you have any question feel free to ask.  See you next time, i  think that will be a classic carbonara!  In the meanwhile Buon  Appetito!!!</p>

<p>*To pasteurize egg  yolks. Whip them with 65 gr sugar while you prepare the syrup with  another 65 gr sugar and 45 gr of water. Wait for the syrup to reach 120°  C. ( 248°F), then pour it very slowly over the whipped yolks, mixing  the syrup well with the yolks if you have a stand mixer and a food  thermometer the operation it&#39;s pretty easy</p>
