<p><strong>Carne Asada</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 lb flat iron steak  </p>

<ul>
<li>Or a steak of your choice: Skirt steak, hanger steak, flat iron, flat iron, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>30 ml Olive Oil</p></li>
<li><p>Juice of 1 Lime</p></li>
<li><p>6 g Salt</p></li>
<li><p>2 g Cumin</p></li>
<li><p>2 g Smoked Paprika</p></li>
<li><p>2 g Ancho Chile Powder</p></li>
<li><p>Shot of mezcal or tequila (optional)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Using a sharp knife, slice the steak across the grain into very thin strips. Add the steak to a large bowl.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, add the olive oil, lime juice, lime zest, salt, cumin, smoked paprika, and chile powder and whisk together. Pour the marinade over the steak and mix with your hands. Cover and let sit in the fridge for 30  minutes or up to 6 hours.<br/></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> While the steak is marinating, you can make fresh tortillas! Also if pressed on time, feel free to skip the time in the fridge, it will still be delicious.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Set a cast-iron over high heat. When ready to cook, add the shot of mezcal and mix it into the steak. The alcohol will help carry aromas and flavors from the marinade. When the cast iron is ripping hot, let the excess marinade drip off the steak and evenly spread out on the cast iron. Grill until the steak is well charred, remove and set on a platter.</li>
<li>Melt cheese with the steak and add to a fresh tortillas to make a quesadilla or serve with rice, salsa, or anything else your heart desires.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Chipotle Cilantro Chimichurri</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 dried chipotle mecco (substitute 1 chipotle in adobo)</li>
<li>Large handful cilantro (stems included)</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
<li>30 ml Olive oil</li>
<li>Juice from 1 lime</li>
<li>Zest from 1/2 lime</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If using dried chiles, remove the stems and seeds. Pour hot water over the chiles and let rehydrate for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>In a food processor, add the chipotle, cilantro, garlic clove, olive oil, lime juice, zest of lime, and a few cranks of black pepper. Pulse until well combined.</li>
<li>Taste it. Add salt as needed. Spoon over carne asada.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Flour Tortillas (adapted from Diana Kennedy)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>450 g bread flour</li>
<li>80 g lard (or butter / vegetable oil)*</li>
<li>5 g coarse kosher salt</li>
<li>250 ml warm water</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Add the flour to a bowl and rub in the lard (or butter) using your finger tips until broken up.</li>
<li>Dissolve the salt in the warm water. Gradually add the water and mix it into the flour mixture to see how much it will absorb.</li>
<li>Turn the dough onto a flat surface and work into a cohesive dough with your hands for about 5 minutes. At the end, the dough should be fairly smooth and not sticking to your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 9 pieces (for a medium burrito size) by weighing them out on a scale (about 80 g). Roll them into very smooth small balls with your hands.<br/></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The dough balls can be stored in your fridge for 3-4 days for on demand fresh tortillas.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Heat a large griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Flatten the tortilla ball and roll out to your desired thinness.</li>
<li>Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle and cook for 10-20 seconds, then flip to the other side to cook for another 10-20 seconds. The tortillas should be lightly browned in spots. Be careful not to overcook the tortilla or else they will become hard instead of soft and pliable.</li>
<li>Immediately, stack the tortillas in a large cloth or clean kitchen towel until you are ready for serving.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Diana’s original recipe calls for 115 g. I made it with that amount the first time around before lowering the amount of fat. The tortillas are just as good texture and flavor wise while saving calories so that’s why I lowered it.</p>
