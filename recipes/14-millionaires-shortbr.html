            <div class="md"><p><strong>Shortbread Crust:</strong></p>

<p>100g or 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, soft.</p>

<p>50g or 1/2 cup Sugar</p>

<p>150g or 1 cup + 2 tbsp All Purpose/Plain Flour</p>

<p><strong>Caramel Filling:</strong></p>

<p>200g or 2/3 cup Condensed Milk</p>

<p>150g or 2/3 cup Unsalted Butter</p>

<p>50g or 1/2 cup Sugar</p>

<p>50g or 3 tbsp Golden Syrup, can also use Honey or Maple Syrup</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Topping:</strong></p>

<p>200g or 1 cup Chocolate Chips/Squares</p>

<p><strong>Prep:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preheat oven to 350F/175C. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper and grease the sides with butter.</p></li>
<li><p>In a bowl, beat sugar and butter to form a smooth paste. Add flour and gently mix it all together. Use your hands to knead and mop up all the crumbs.</p></li>
<li><p>Flatten crust inside pan and try to level it as much as you can. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until your crust is a light golden brown around the edges. Let it cool in the pan.</p></li>
<li><p>While your crust is baking, start the caramel. Put all filling ingredients into a saucepan and place on medium-high heat, stirring gently. Watch it closely as you stir. If you see little brown slivers at the bottom of the pan, stir them in vigorously and turn the heat down to a low-medium. Simmer it gently until it reaches a deep, golden brown color. It should take around 15 minutes.  </p></li>
<li><p>When ready, pour the caramel over the cooled biscuit crust and spread evenly using an offset spatula or knife. Let this cool for at least an hour. You don’t want the caramel to be warm or it’ll ruin your chocolate. Don’t cool in the fridge or else you’ll end up with a hard mess. </p></li>
<li><p>Melt chocolate using microwave or double boiler and pour over cooled caramel to finish off.</p></li>
<li><p>To serve, heat up a knife using hot water (make sure you dry it) or a blowtorch. This will ensure you get a nice clean cut. Cut into whatever size slices you want; I usually go for 1-inch squares.</p></li>
</ol>
