<p>Have fun and make your own bread!!</p>

<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>

<ul>
<li>1.75 ounces warm water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry yeast</li>
<li>16 ounces flour (500 g)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>10 ounces cool water (we might need less water)</li>
<li>Grain poppy, sesame seeds, flex seeds or additional flour for decorating.</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<p>Place warm water in a small bowl and add the yeast, mix then set aside.Put the flour in a large bowl, add the salt and stir. Make a hole in the center, add the yeast mixture and stir.</p>

<p>Add the cool water, little at a time, while stirring by hands or using a spoon. The dough must be shaggy and sticky (you may not use all of the water, depending on how absorbing the flour is.)</p>

<p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes rest.</p>

<p>Add some flour in your kitchen surface to work the dough, use your hands to press it and to make sure you are releasing all the air bubbles from it. it should take around 5 minutes to work your dough well. if the dough is still sticky (Because you used more water than supposed to, add some flour until the dough is not sticky anymore.)</p>

<p>Place the dough in a bowl, and cover again with plastic wrap, set aside and let it rest for 1h30 at least.</p>

<p>Divide the dough into 4, and shape each portion into a long loaf (each one should be 12 inches long and 1.5 inches in diameter), place them on a floured towel, and cover them with another towel or an oiled plastic wrap. Allow 30 minutes to rise.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees, and place a pan of water on the bottom rack.</p>

<p>Transfer the baguettes on top of a baking sheet, and sprinkle each one with the seeds to decorate, make 4 slashes in each loaf using a sharp knife then place in the oven to bake for 35 to 40 minutes. To make sure your baguette is well cooked, it should make a hollow sound when tapped.</p>

<p>Serve with anything you want or slice them to make bruschettas. If you are not going to use all of them in the same day or the day after.Freeze them until further use.</p>

<p>Edit: 12 inches long instead of 15, sorry I am not used to inches, just moved to Canada, and trying to adapt :)  </p>
