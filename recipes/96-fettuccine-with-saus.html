<p>This is the very first meal I prepared in our new home! It&#39;s so delicious and easy to make.</p>

<p>Equipment</p>

<ul>
<li>Large pot</li>
<li>Wide skillet</li>
</ul>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>16 ounces fettuccine</li>
<li>2 teaspoons neutral frying oil</li>
<li>1 pound hot Italian sausage loose</li>
<li>1 shallot peeled and sliced</li>
<li>1 leek trimmed, washed, and sliced into half-moons</li>
<li>10 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed, scrubbed, and thinly sliced</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic peeled and minced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1/2 cup white wine or chicken stock</li>
<li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
<li>15 ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh parsley minced</li>
</ul>

<p>InstructionsStart the Pasta:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fettuccine until al dente. Remove 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking water from the pot. Drain the pasta and set aside. <em>\</em>Note, if you time it right, the pasta should be done as the sauce finishes simmering. If possible, simply using a spider strainer to transfer the cooked pasta directly to the sauce.*</li>
</ul>

<p>Start the Sauce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, for 10-13 minutes until mostly cooked through and beginning to crisp up around the edges.</li>
<li>Add the sliced shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until it begins to soften. After the shallot softens, add the sliced leeks and cook an additional 5-6 minutes until it softens.</li>
<li>Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms soften and begin to brown. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer the Sauce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Melt the butter into the skillet. Once it is melted and frothy, add the white wine, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the chicken stock and tomatoes. Simmer for 30 minutes, adding more liquid (water or stock) as necessary if the sauce becomes too thick or sticks to the skillet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sauce the Pasta:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transfer the cooked fettuccine and the minced parsley to the skillet along with the reserved pasta cooking water and toss to coat until the pasta is glossy and well-coated.</li>
</ul>
