<p><strong>For the pork:</strong></p>

<p>*1 tbsp sunflower oil
*800g piece boneless pork belly, cut into thick slices
*4 tbsp light muscovado sugar
*3 garlic cloves, sliced
*thumb-sized piece ginger sliced
*2 star anise
*100ml Shaosing rice wine
*2 tbsp dark soy sauce
*large pinch of Chinese five-spice powder</p>

<p><strong>For the buns:</strong>
*250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
*1 tbsp white caster sugar
*1 tsp baking powder
*2 tsp fast-action dried yeast
*50ml milk
*1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing</p>

<p><strong>For the crushed chilli peanuts:</strong>
*handful roasted peanuts
*1 tsp chilli powder</p>

<p><strong>To serve:</strong>
*coriander leaves
*cucumber batons
*shredded spring onion
*Gratted carrot</p>

<p><strong>Method</strong></p>

<p>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish over a medium-high heat. In batches, brown the pork belly well, then transfer to a plate. Tip the sugar into the dish and cook over a medium heat until starting to dissolve and caramelise, then quickly stir in the garlic, ginger and star anise, and cook for 1 min.</p>

<p>Carefully pour in the rice wine and soy sauce – watch out, it will spatter – and simmer to dissolve the sugar. Stir the pork into the caramel to coat, then add 100ml water and the five-spice, and bring to a simmer. Put the lid on and cook in the oven for 1 hr 30 mins. Remove from the oven, uncover, put on a high heat to simmer and reduce the sauce until sticky. Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and chilled. Reheat with a splash of water.</p>

<p>To make the chilli peanuts, mash most of the peanuts using a pestle and mortar, then add the rest of the nuts and roughly crush for a chunky texture. Stir through the chilli powder. Can be made 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight container.</p>

<p>For the buns, tip the dry ingredients and a large pinch of salt into a food mixer fitted with a dough hook. Pour in the milk, oil and 100ml tepid water, and work the mixture for about 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to double in size (for about 1 hr)</p>

<p>Tip the dough onto a floured surface and roll into a sausage shape. Cut the sausage into 10 equal portions. Roll each portion into a bun, then use a rolling pin to roll each bun out into an oval. Lightly grease each one, then fold them over a greased chopstick or skewer and place on a lightly oiled baking tray to rest for 1 hr or until doubled in size. Remove the chopstick or skewer before steaming.</p>

<p>Heat a steamer and steam the buns on circles of baking parchment in batches for about 10 mins until puffed up. Split the buns and stuff each one with a slice or two of the pork, drizzled with some of the sauce. Scatter over some coriander, cucumber and spring onions, then sprinkle with the crushed nuts and tuck in.</p>
