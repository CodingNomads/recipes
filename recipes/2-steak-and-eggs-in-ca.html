            <p class="subtitle is-3 author">by irharrier2</p>
            <div class="md"><p>Here is my recipe that is modified version of a couple online versions with extra added details that helped get it just correct. It is good enough for a brunch for two!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>250g or heaver ribeye steak (if your steak is below this weight, skip the oven cooking part)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>Store bought hash brown</li>
<li>1 tomato cut in half or cherry tomatoes on the vine</li>
<li>4-5 brown mushrooms, cleaned and destemmed</li>
<li>0.5 tbsp. of Butter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instruction:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Start by baking the hash brown according to the packaging (always go 5 mins longer to get them extra crispy)</li>
<li>Rub the steak with oil (something that can take high heat) and salt. Let it rest.</li>
<li>Wash and dry mushroom and tomato</li>
<li>3-5 minutes before hash browns are ready, set the cast iron on high heat (don&#39;t put any oil as steak is coated in oil).</li>
<li>Once hash brown is taken out, lower the oven to 130c.</li>
<li>Place the tomato and mushrooms in the pan along with the steak. Sear both side of steak, one minute per side. Hit your vegetables with seasoning and olive oil.</li>
<li>Place in oven for 5-7 minutes (or until it reaches 60c for medium), take out pan and place it on medium heat on the stove. Remove the steak and let it rest .</li>
<li>Add butter to the place that you wanna put the eggs, and put the excess (if any) on top of the steak. Fit the hash browns on the side to heat up while cooking.</li>
<li>Crack the eggs and season them. Take it of the heat before they are fully cooked.</li>
<li> I like to cut the steak before returning it to the pan along with all the accumulated juices.</li>
<li>Serve with a slice of toasted bread (dark or sourdough bread recommended)</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit 1: I got the bulk of the recipe from <a href="https://youtu.be/p163jQLW5Z0">this link</a>. I love this guy for munchie recipes but he doesn’t write a detailed recipe and always misses out the details and cooking temperatures. So based on my experience and a couple of other online recipes, I wrote down everything that you need in order to get it correct.</p>

<p>Edit 2: wow guys, thank you for all the kind words and awards. It has been a pleasure spending my evening with you.
I hope I didn’t miss any questions.</p>
