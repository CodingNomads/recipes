<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 c potatoes, shredded</li>
<li>1-1/2 Tbsp butter</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Place shredded potatoes in a bowl and fill with cool water, then immediately drain. Repeat this process about four times, until water runs clear.</li>
<li>Place potatoes in a mesh sieve, just to drain off excess water, then place potatoes on a clean kitchen towel.</li>
<li>By twisting and squeezing the towel, squeeze out as much water from the potatoes as possible; repeat several times.</li>
<li>Heat 1-1/2 Tbsp of butter in a pan over low heat.</li>
<li>Add 1 c of shredded potatoes to pan and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Press down lightly on top of potatoes with a spatula, just to flatten it slightly. Then don&#39;t touch it.</li>
<li>After 5 to 6 minutes, when the bottom has firmed up, sticks together, and is lightly browned, flip it over and cook for another 4 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Variation: Loose Shredded Hash Browns</h4>

<ul>
<li>Follow same steps as above, but instead of pressing the shredded potatoes into a patty, stir them around every minute or so, lightly browning all sides, making sure to keep everything in one thin layer. This technique will take about 6 minutes.</li>
</ul>
