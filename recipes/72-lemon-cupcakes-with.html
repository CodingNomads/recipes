            <div class="md"><p>For the lemon cupcakes</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
<li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 Tablespoons lemon zest</li>
<li>1/3 cup (80ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add eggs and vanilla extract, then beat on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Set aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, start the mixer on low speed, then slowly add the milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Once combined, stop the mixer. Do not overmix this batter.</p></li>
<li><p>Spoon batter evenly into 12 cupcake liners, filling them about 2/3 full. Bake for about 18-22 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the middle will come out clean when they’re done.</p></li>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>3 egg whites</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar + 1 additional tbsp</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar)</li>
<li>12 tbsp butter</li>
<li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 cups frozen berries</li>
</ul>

<p>Directions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separate your egg whites from the yolks, making sure not a single drop of yolk ends up in the whites. Place your egg whites in a heatproof bowl. Reserve yolks for another purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in 3/4 cup of sugar and set the bowl over a pot that is simmering with a couple inches of water.</p></li>
<li><p>Whisk the egg whites and sugar constantly until all the sugar is dissolved. You can use your fingers to feel if there are still granules of sugar in the egg mixture. Then take it off the pot.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in your salt and lemon juice. Then on medium-high speed, beat the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. You know you have reached this stage when you can overturn the bowl and none of the meringue falls out. Avoid over-beating.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in your softened butter about a tablespoon at a time, making sure you mix in between each tablespoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix in your vanilla.</p></li>
<li><p>Over medium heat, cook the berries with a tablespoon of sugar. Allow the berries to break down, using a wooden spoon to help burst them.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to simmer and allow the mixture to thicken and reduce down to about a 1/3 cup of liquid.</p></li>
<li><p>Take off the heat and strain the berry sauce to get rid of the seeds and fibers.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the sauce to cool down before adding to your buttercream.</p></li>
