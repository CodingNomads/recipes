<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h4>Prepare the Rice Noodles:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Prepare the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain, rinse, and drizzle with sesame oil and a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Start the Sauce:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Heat the neutral cooking oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic and red Fresno peppers and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
<li>Arrange the sliced tomatoes in the skillet and cook for 4-6 minutes until they begin to char and soften; be careful not to burn the onions. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Add the basil leaves and chicken stock and gently turn the tomatoes. Carefully mash some of the tomatoes into the sauce and leave some of the tomatoes whole. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, adding more chicken stock if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cook the Steak:</h4>

<ul>
<li>As the sauce simmers, cook the steak. Pat the ribeye dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the steak and cook for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness. About 1 minute before removing the steak, add the butter into the skillet and tilt the skillet toward you. Baste the steak with the butter as it finishes searing. Turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Transfer the steak to a cutting board to rest for 5-7 minutes before slicing thinly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sauce the Noodles:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Transfer the cooked rice noodles to the skillet with the sauce and toss gently to combine. Taste and season again with salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To Serve:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Divide the noodles between bowls and arrange the sliced steak on top. Garnish with a few basil leaves, a drizzle of chili oil, and a drizzle of sesame oil. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
